    <Engilsh173>Are you left handed?</Engilsh173>    
    <Engilsh174>It's been two weeks since the killings began</Engilsh174>    
    <Engilsh175>At first the authorities thought a serial killer was behind it</Engilsh175>   
    <Engilsh176>But the state of the bodies and the number of casualties said otherwise</Engilsh176>   
    <Engilsh177>And then came the darkness...</Engilsh177>   
    <Engilsh178>Murderer. I'm taking you in</Engilsh178>   
    <Engilsh179>I'm impressed. You were able to track me.</Engilsh179>

    <Engilsh182>.........</Engilsh182>   
    <Engilsh183>Shortly after picking up his cousin</Engilsh183>   
    <Engilsh184>His home was attacked and wrecked by a member of a cult</Engilsh184>   
    <Engilsh185>His cousin, Raila, and his friend, Subiya, were badly hurt</Engilsh185>  
    <Engilsh186>After they recovered, he decided it would be best to train them in order for them to defend themselves</Engilsh186>   
    <Engilsh187>They retired to a secluded location to train, away from the ensuing chaos</Engilsh187>   
    <Engilsh188>You did well</Engilsh188>   
    <Engilsh189>*gasp* *gasp* Doesn't feel like it</Engilsh189>   
    <Engilsh190>*ring* *ring*</Engilsh190>   
    <Engilsh191>Hey, its me</Engilsh191>   
    <Engilsh192>To what do I owe this pleasure?</Engilsh192>   
    <Engilsh193>The Royal Court, has decided to go after the criminals</Engilsh193>   
    <Engilsh194>Really?</Engilsh194>   
    <Engilsh195>Yes, we'd need as many able bodied Saints as possible, care to join the cause?</Engilsh195>   
    <Engilsh196>Well...</Engilsh196>   
    <Engilsh197>Go ahead</Engilsh197>   
    <Engilsh198>Yeah, we aren't babies we can take care of ourselves. The Kingdom needs you more than we do</Engilsh198>   
    <Engilsh199>Lynx, proceeded to return to Acacia. Leaving his two students to train in his absence.</Engilsh199>   
    <Engilsh200>Welcome back</Engilsh200>   
    <Engilsh201>Thanks</Engilsh201>   
    <Engilsh202>Yo, not so fast. We gotta make sure you're fit for duty</Engilsh202>   
    <Engilsh203>Seriously?</Engilsh203>   
    <Engilsh204>Yup</Engilsh204>   
    <Engilsh205>fine, lets do this</Engilsh205>   
    <Engilsh206>Finally</Engilsh206>   
    <Engilsh207>Looks like its just you and me huh</Engilsh207>   
    <Engilsh208>I think we should head back to the mainland?</Engilsh208>   
    <Engilsh209>What?</Engilsh209>   
    <Engilsh210>Hiding out on this island doesn't feel right, we should be out there</Engilsh210>   
    <Engilsh211>In case you hadn't noticed, we haven't even passed the physical exam</Engilsh211>   
    <Engilsh212>And we totally got wrecked by that psycho dude</Engilsh212>   
    <Engilsh213>We aren't trained Saints, rushing to battle in this state - </Engilsh213>   
    <Engilsh214>OW</Engilsh214>   
    <Engilsh215>What was that?</Engilsh215>   
    <Engilsh216>I think you've underestimated our growth</Engilsh216>
    <Engilsh217>Come, I'll show you how far we've grown.</Engilsh217>    
    <Engilsh218>Somewhere</Engilsh218>    
    <Engilsh219>An argument breaks out between two allies</Engilsh219>    
    <Engilsh220>Listen, I'll be the one leading the assault tomorrow</Engilsh220>    
    <Engilsh221>Adam, already agreed to it</Engilsh221>    
    <Engilsh222>Exactly</Engilsh222>    
    <Engilsh223>This is lame, how come I never get to be in charge?</Engilsh223>    
    <Engilsh224>because you are immature, childish, reckless, stupid</Engilsh224>    
    <Engilsh225>you'd jeopardize the mission</Engilsh225>    
    <Engilsh226>Indeed, I don't even know why we kept you to begin with</Engilsh226>    
    <Engilsh227>Harsh</Engilsh227>    
    <Engilsh228>I've had enough of this. You punk!!!</Engilsh228>    
    <Engilsh229>Lets see if you can back up your talk</Engilsh229>    
    <Engilsh230>Hmph</Engilsh230>    
    <Engilsh231>Ugh</Engilsh231>    
    <Engilsh232>Satisfied?</Engilsh232>    
    <Engilsh233>You son of a</Engilsh233>    
    <Engilsh234>Shut up Rav. You're being childish</Engilsh234>    
    <Engilsh235>Indeed, that was fairly ridiculous</Engilsh235>    
    <Engilsh236>Adam? When did you get here???</Engilsh236>    
    <Engilsh237>Just five seconds ago</Engilsh237>    
    <Engilsh238>Cocky as always....</Engilsh238>    
    <Engilsh239>Indeed, I hope you've made some progress</Engilsh239>    
    <Engilsh240>Yes, we invade tomorrow</Engilsh240>    
    <Engilsh241>And are you prepared?</Engilsh241>    
    <Engilsh242>We've gathered enough souls to power the device</Engilsh242>    
    <Engilsh243>Excellent</Engilsh243>    
    <Engilsh244>We've also been training like crazy, they wont stand a chance against all 5 of us</Engilsh244>    
    <Engilsh245>Of course, I can beat you down to prove it</Engilsh245>    
    <Engilsh246>Um that’s not a good idea</Engilsh246> 
    <Engilsh247>Actually, it is. I'm in the mood for a sparring match. Come with all youve got</Engilsh247>    
    <Engilsh248>I'll put in half the effort</Engilsh248>    
    <Engilsh249>Cocky!</Engilsh249>    
    <Engilsh250>heh heh heh</Engilsh250>    
    <Engilsh251>The following day....</Engilsh251>    
    <Engilsh252>Adam and his men stormed the Academy</Engilsh252>    
    <Engilsh253>The lower rank Saints were no match for them</Engilsh253>    
    <Engilsh254>During the ensuing chaos. Two fates, crossed paths yet again</Engilsh254>    
    <Engilsh255>So you're back, how long has it been</Engilsh255>    
    <Engilsh256>200 years, give or take</Engilsh256> 
    <Engilsh257>What do you want Adam?</Engilsh257>    
    <Engilsh258>Don't play dumb! You know what I want</Engilsh258>    
    <Engilsh259>The Artifact, "The Crest of Hope"</Engilsh259>    
    <Engilsh260>The council will never allow that</Engilsh260>    
    <Engilsh261>*Hmph* I'm not asking</Engilsh261>    
    <Engilsh262>PREPARE TO DIE!!!</Engilsh262>    
    <Engilsh263>Maaaaaaan, looks like were missing an epic party</Engilsh263>    
    <Engilsh264>This is gonna be bad</Engilsh264>    
    <Engilsh265>Well, what do we have here?</Engilsh265>    
    <Engilsh266>YOU!!!</Engilsh266>    
    <Engilsh267>Yeah, me</Engilsh267>    
    <Engilsh268>Rai, get out of here, I'll handle this guy</Engilsh268>    
    <Engilsh269>Good luck</Engilsh269>    
    <Engilsh270>Inside the academy</Engilsh270>    
    <Engilsh271>Argh, you injured me</Engilsh271>    
    <Engilsh272>Whatever, I still got what I want</Engilsh272>    
    <Engilsh273>Stop!</Engilsh273>    
    <Engilsh274>Hmph, you're too weak to stop me now</Engilsh274>    
    <Engilsh275>Not so fast</Engilsh275>    
    <Engilsh276>Lynx?</Engilsh276>    
    <Engilsh277>Fool, you don't stand a</Engilsh277>

    <Engilsh319>Tutorial</Engilsh319>    
    <Engilsh320>Hi, welcome to the tutorial.</Engilsh320>
    <Engilsh321>This will teach you how to play..... obviously.</Engilsh321>
    <Engilsh322>First up, the Heads-Up display (HUD ).</Engilsh322>
    <Engilsh323>This, my friends, is your characterEnum Heath Bar.</Engilsh323>
    <Engilsh324>It displays your characterEnum Health Points (HP) as both digits and a percentage.</Engilsh324>
    <Engilsh325>Once your HP goes below zero, or is less than your opponents at the end of a match....</Engilsh325>
    <Engilsh326>You're dead, shocker.</Engilsh326>
    <Engilsh327>Same principle applies to your opponent.</Engilsh327>
    <Engilsh328>Next, your Command Menu (CM), which houses your Move-set.</Engilsh328>
    <Engilsh329>All your characterEnum moves are shown in the Command Menu.</Engilsh329>
    <Engilsh330>Moves are split into 3 categories: Physical, Celestia and Items.</Engilsh330>
    <Engilsh331>Physical moves rely on raw brute force to inflict damage.</Engilsh331>
    <Engilsh332>Celestia moves use Celestia Powers to enhance attacks or activate special abilities.</Engilsh332>
    <Engilsh333>And Items, tend to augment your character or sabotage your opponent.</Engilsh333>
    <Engilsh334>You can navigate through these sections using RIGHT/LEFT, A/D or Scroll Up/Down.</Engilsh334>
    <Engilsh335>All you have to do is select a a single move to Que it up.</Engilsh335>
    <Engilsh336>More on that later</Engilsh336>
    <Engilsh337>The Activity Bar (AB) is directly linked to your Command Menu (CM).</Engilsh337>
    <Engilsh338>It fills up over time and automatically governs your Turn.</Engilsh338>
    <Engilsh339>You cant do anything unless your AB is fully charged.</Engilsh339>
    <Engilsh340>As you can see, your CM is disabled while your AB is not fully charged.</Engilsh340>
    <Engilsh341>When your AB is fully activated, your CM is enabled, magic!!!</Engilsh341>
    <Engilsh342>You can now proceed to Que up attacks.</Engilsh342>    
    <Engilsh343>Press ENTER to Skip</Engilsh343>
    <Engilsh344>This is the Time Counter, here set to infinite</Engilsh344>
    <Engilsh345>Some rounds have a time limit, and you will see the countdown here.</Engilsh345>
    <Engilsh346>And now for the fun part!</Engilsh346>
    <Engilsh347>As you can see, you initially have 4 empty slots.</Engilsh347>
    <Engilsh348>You can select any move from any section.</Engilsh348>
    <Engilsh349>And your slots will fill up.</Engilsh349>
    <Engilsh350>Once all four have filled up, your attacks will be executed in sequence.</Engilsh350>
    <Engilsh367>After execution, your slots will become free yet again</Engilsh367>
    <Engilsh351>The same applies to your opponent.</Engilsh351>
    <Engilsh352>This is the fury bar.</Engilsh352>
    <Engilsh353>It fills up as both characterEnum attack.</Engilsh353>
    <Engilsh354>When full, you can pull off a rage/fury combo.</Engilsh354>

    <Engilsh361>You trigger Fury/Rage by pressing 'L' or clicking on the Flashing Fury Icon.</Engilsh361>
    <Engilsh362>Note, only one player can activate Fury at a time.</Engilsh362>
    <Engilsh363>If your opponent triggers it first, you are in TROUBLE.</Engilsh363>
