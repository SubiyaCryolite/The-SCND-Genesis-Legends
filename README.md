The SCND Genesis: Legends is a fighting game based on the comic The SCND Genesis. The battle system is a hybrid of turn based RPG's and conventional 2D Fighters. The game has a hand-drawn comic book graphical style and has other anime style effects. Legends RMX is an "Enhanced Edition" of the original 2011 release.

This was my first big Java project that I created while in college and it shows.
