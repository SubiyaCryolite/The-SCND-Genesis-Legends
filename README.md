The SCND Genesis: Legends is a fighting game based on my web-comic The SCND Genesis. The battle system is a hybrid of turn based RPG's and conventional 2D Fighters. The game has a hand-drawn comic book graphical style and has other anime style effects. This was my first big Java project that I created while in college and it shows. Please use this only as a reference and not groundwork for new projects ^_^
